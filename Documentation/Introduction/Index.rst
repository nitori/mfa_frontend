What does it do?
----------------

This extension adds support for Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to TYPO3's
Frontend.

It supports TYPO3 v10 LTS, v11 LTS and v12 LTS.

MFA can be configured by editing a ``fe_users`` record in the TYPO3 Backend. A
Frontend plugin is provided to allow users to configure their MFA settings
themselves.

.. note::

   This extension has been initially inspired by
   `[codeFareith] Google Authenticator <https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/cf_google_authenticator>`__
   but it has been rewritten and extended as that former extension was not
   actively maintained anymore. Thanks to the original author
   Robin "codeFareith" von den Bergen for the inspiration!
