Applications
============

You can use various Authenticator applications. To name a few of them:

- Google Authenticator
  (`iOS / iPadOS <https://apps.apple.com/ch/app/google-authenticator/id388497605>`__,
  `Android <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2>`__)
- Microsoft Authenticator
  (`iOS / iPadOS <https://apps.apple.com/ch/app/microsoft-authenticator/id983156458>`__,
  `Android <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.azure.authenticator>`__)
- Twilio Authy
  (`iOS / iPadOS <https://apps.apple.com/ch/app/twilio-authy/id494168017>`__,
  `Android <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy>`__)

An alternative to a dedicated application is to use a Password Manager that
supports MFA. For example, `1Password <https://1password.com/>`__ or
`Bitwarden <https://bitwarden.com/>`__.

if you use 1Password, you can use the following link to see how to configure
OTP for an existing Login entry (username + password) you have in your vault:
https://support.1password.com/one-time-passwords/.
